Hey!
This repository is a compilation of all python projects I did alongside learning the language.
1. Pong - the old classic Pong game built using python. I intended to add a sound effect too but couldn't find and place the right file. Will update later.
2. Calculator - a simple calculator with minimal GUI, I built while learning tkinter.
3. Photo viewer - a basic image viewer application created using tkinter
4. Snake - created a little Snake game, using tkinter and pygame
